# The Diom Programming language

This is mostly a language written because:

1. I haven't written a compiler in a while
2. I wanted to give it a go in rust :P
3. I wanted to give a language with minimal syntax a go
4. I like expression-driven languages but don't want to be stuck with FP
5. I've gotten interested in Algebraic effects
